I realize a set of these cost just a few bucks, but I needed one, not four, so I figured I'd just print one.  I found a couple of models elsewhere, but they weren't all that great once printed, so I put my own together.

The OpenScAD file is all you really need.  The gcode was for a PLA (I think) print that worked.
