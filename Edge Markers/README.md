# Edge Markers for square Aluminum Tubing
I coach and mentor FIRST Robotics teams and our FRC team primarily builds out of square aluminum tubing, either 1"x1" or 1"x2" primarily.  We do most of our fabrication with woodworking tools, so precision is hard to come by and precision and consistency can make all the difference during the competitions (when things go wrong)
A majority of the time, we need holes drilled in the center line or 1/2" from the edge of the tubing, so I designed these edge markers to simplify the process.  The lip goes along the edge of the material and there are tic marks ever 1/8".  The slot will be 1/2" (you can adjust everything in the OpenSCAD file) from the edge, so as long as you are consistent with measuring against a reference edge, you'll be in line.
I use a 0.5mm mechanical pencil for marking, and there's enough room at the tic marks for a punch.
